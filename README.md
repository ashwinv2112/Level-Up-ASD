# Level-Up-ASD
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder having issues with social communication, interests, coordination, attention, and health. People with autism are very sensitive and cannot afford a minor change in their surrounding environment. Using Java, this work is an interactive learning tool designed to support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The project utilizes game-based learning to enhance autistic children's cognitive skills, social interaction, and logical reasoning.
